All Giddy-up! mods except Giddy-up! Mechanoids have been updated to support Rimworld version 1.1 (including the expansion). Credits for this update go to Sarg Bjornson, who's responsible for a major part of this update. This version also supports Rimworld 1.0, so no need to worry if you're still using that version. 

Giddy-up! Mechanoids will be updated once What the Hack has been updates (which will take some time). 

This update includes the following improvements and fixes: 
- Added more overlays for vanilla animals. These overlays prevent that pawns overlap the heads, horns or other things that animals have. 
- Made sure the name tag of a pawn doesn't overlap the animal's head when an animal is mounted. 
- Fixed null reference errors that the wait for rider job sometimes threw.
- Compatibility with the new HugsLib version.

Giddy up has been updated with the following changes!

- Large performance improvement. Your game should run noticably smoother. Giddy-up should barely impact FPS from now on. 
- Added built-in support for the Multiplayer mod (credits go to Cody-Spring)
- Fixed a nasty issue that could occur when you change allowed areas, resulting in pawns getting stuck. 
- Fixed Giddy-up Caravan issue that could result in caravans being overloaded after leaving the map. Credits go to okradonkey for this fix. 
- The potential inventory mass of pawns is substracted from the mass a mounted animal can carry when world travelling. In other words: things a pawn carry no longer get a free ride when riding.

All Giddy-up! mods except Giddy-up! Mechanoids have been updated to support Rimworld version 1.2 (with multi-version support for 1.0 and 1.1). Giddy up Mechanoids will be updated once I'm done with the What the Hack update. Enjoy!

Giddy-up Core has been updated. Changes: 
- Improved performance (credits go to Karim for this). 
- Fixed multiplayer mod support (credits go to AriAlavi a.k.a KIERKEGÃ˜RD). Giddy-up is fully compatible with the multiplayer mod again, though with the following known (minor) issues: 
    - If using arbiter and battlemounts, firing from a mount will cause a desync
    - NPCs riding animals does not draw for the host, only clients (eventually leading to 
	  desync). Therefore, NPC mounting is automatically disabled in the settings for 
	  multiplayer users by default. 

Thanks go to the testers of this update as well:

- Diego75547

Giddy-up up, and all its sub mods have been updated to be compatible with Rimworld 1.3. 
First I want to thank Ogliss for being of great help during the update process. 

This update comes with the following changes: 
- 1.3 compatibility (of course :))
- Compatibility with the new pen mechanic. 
- Fixed issue of not loading the mounted state properly when reloading the game 
- Giddy-up Ride and Roll: Improved auto mount mechani. Decision whether the auto-mount or not should be better now. 
- Giddy-up Caravan: Changed how caravan speed is modified. The vanilla mechanic is used instead. You can still configure which animals 
are ridden by which pawns, so they ride them when leaving/arriving. But this is not mandatory. 
- Giddy-up Caravan: Changed what animals can be ridden in vanilla so that it matches what you configured in Giddy-up. 


&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Known issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;: Ride and roll can cause animals roaming the map sometimes. I tried limiting this, but some occurences of it are hard to fix. 
For instance, if an animal is sleep deprived, it will go to sleep. Giddy-up doesn't allow pawns to mount sleep-deprived animals, so the animal will be left where it is. 
Fixing all of these issues requires more time than I have right now, and I didn't want to stall the update any longer. If you come across an issue like this, and feel like there's an easy solution, please report it. 

As you might know I'm not really active as modder anymore, but I do intend to keep all my mods alive. The reason I'm no longer active is because I'm working on my own game: &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cursed Crew&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. If you like my work, be sure to check it out! You can find a link to Cursed Crew the mod page of every mod I created. 

Enjoy the update!

Cheers,
Roolo
